"<b>This Is How Me Do It</b>" is a collection of records.
More precisely, how <b>ME DID</b> it in the past.
At the time you read this, ME might do it differently,
You might ask why "<b>ME</b>", not "<b>I</b>"?
Because <b>ME</b> rhymes better.


So, it is <b>NOT</b> about the <b>BEST PRACTICE</b> to do something!
No animals were harmed during creating this page.
No original ideas were used on this page.
Most ideas were shamelessly stolen from "Here, There, and Everywhere",
including but not limited to "bootstrap", "stack overflow", "Mike Dane",
"w3schools", et al.

If you like it, you can whatever you want: clone it, or fork it, or copy it, or even ignore it!
