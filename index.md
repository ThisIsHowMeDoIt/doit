**"[This Is](https://youtu.be/jEoM3qan9Gs)"** a collection of
**"[How Me Do It](https://youtu.be/jEoM3qan9Gs)"** records.
More precisely, how me <b>DID</b> it in the past.
At the time you read this, it might already be done differently!
You might ask why "<b>ME</b>", not "<b>I</b>"?
Because <b>ME</b> rhymes better.


Therefore, this is <b>NOT</b> about the <b>BEST PRACTICE</b> to do something!
No animals were harmed while creating this page.
No original ideas were used on this page.
Most ideas were shamelessly stolen from "Here, There, and Everywhere",
including but not limited to 
"bootstrap", 
"GitHub Page Themes",
"Mike Dane",
"stack overflow", 
"w3schools", 
et al.

This site was developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/)

Unfortunately, it is <b>NOT</b> "mobile-friendly" (yet).
If you like it, you can do whatever you want: clone it, or fork it, or copy it, or even ignore it!
