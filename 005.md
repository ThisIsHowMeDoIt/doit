## Jekyll on a VirtualBox Debian Guest 

Ever heard how "great" Ruby is?
If that is really true, how come not many are (still) using it?
Ruby is free software, i.e. it is free if you have free time!
IMHO, the greatest f*ing problem of Ruby is 
"Just because version X works fine, version X+1 should work fine too!"
Therefore, stick with version X until it is obsolete or is vulnerable.
Why using Ruby anyway? 
Because GitHub and GitHub Page were developed with it and so does Jekyll.

This page is about how to install Jekyll with Rbenv on a VirtualBox Debian Guest.
Why Rbenv? Because <b>This Is How Me Do It</b>!
It works today but no warranty it will still work the day after.
Take it or leave it.
And, you have been warned!

## SuperUser (root) Settings

You need to have root (substitute SuperUser "su -" or "sudo su -") access for the first part of the installation.
For the next part, just user privilege is needed.
