This page is about building a GitHub Page with no [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/).
It is assumed that you know and have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, and know how to setup
a [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/).

## Creating A New GitHub Repository

Create a new GitHub repository with a LEAST a simple README.md file.
By the way, GitHub has changed the default branch name to "main" (was "master").
In this example, the main branch name will be "master".

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets//images/doit-001.jpg" style="width:960px;">
<br>

Click "Setting" and scroll to the "GitHub Page" options:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets//images/doit-002.jpg" style="width:960px;">
<br>

Choose and save your GitHub Page source. In this example:
* Branch: master
* Root:   /
* NO THEME
<br>

After a while (up to 10 minutes!), check if your GitHub Page appears.
If no "index.html" nor "index.md" exist, GitHub Page will display the "README.md" file.
Therefore, make sure that at least a simple "README.md" file exists!
Before continue, make sure that your GitHub Page is up!

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets//images/doit-003.jpg" style="width:960px;">

## Using your own domain name (eg. doit.vlsm.org)

You might want to set your own domain.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets//images/doit-004.jpg" style="width:960px;">
<br>

See also <https://doit.vlsm.org>.
Your domain name is stored in "CNAME" file.

```
$ cat CNAME 
doit.vlsm.org
$ 
```

Last, you have to set your domain. In this example, "doit.vlsm.org" is set as an alias (CNAME) of "thisishowmedoit.github.io".

```
$ host doit.vlsm.org
doit.vlsm.org is an alias for thisishowmedoit.github.io.
thisishowmedoit.github.io has address 185.199.111.153
thisishowmedoit.github.io has address 185.199.109.153
thisishowmedoit.github.io has address 185.199.110.153
thisishowmedoit.github.io has address 185.199.108.153
$ 
```
